An ecommerce store wants to entice its visitors to specific behaviors as: **Acquisition** (ex: Sign Up for an Account), **Activation** (ex: Purchasing a Product), **Retention** (ex: Recurrent Customers buying new Product or using Promotions), **Referral** (ex: Inviting friends to join the ecommerce store), this are part of the Dave McClure's [startup metrics for pirates AARRR](http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version). One way to achieve this is to communicate a **call to action** for the *visitor*. This extension allows to manage a gallery with call to actions and associated pictures.
